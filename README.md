Snake Game:

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to navigate the snake to eat food while avoiding collisions with the walls or its own tail. The snake grows longer each time it eats food, and the game becomes progressively more challenging as the snake's length increases.

Features:
- Classic Snake Gameplay: Control the snake to eat food and grow longer.
- Simple Controls: Use keyboard arrows to direct the snake.
- Score Tracking: Keep track of the score based on the number of food items eaten.
- Game Over Conditions: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (usually included with Python)

Installation:
1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Snake-Game
3. Run the game: python main.py

Scoring
- You earn points each time the snake eats food. The score increases as the snake grows longer.
